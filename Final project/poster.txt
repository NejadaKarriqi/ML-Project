posters:
shorten your text lines:  consider breaking your text into four columns.
JUSTIFY THE RIGHT WAY:Left justifying text makes for an easier read.
consider the font: University, suggests a font size of 85pt for the title, 36–44 for the headers, and 24–34 for the body text.suggests fonts like Helvetica or Gill Sans for the body and a serif for the titles.
Conclusions: the conclusion are suggested to be placed at top of the rightmost column—or, start the body of the poster with it.
colors: no reds on blues, or reds on yellows. Instead, use a background in a muted color—one that is closer to white on the color spectrum—for a more professional tone.
Check for readability at 6 feet; judge your layout choices; make sure all columns are aligned; use black as the text color.
Always title your graphs
Highlight the peak, trough, or other comparison of interest with an arrow containing the value of that data point.
Is useful to include a simple description of how you got the data you’re presenting near the graph
The graphs should tell the whole story; “If you removed all the info besides the graphics, the poster should still be pretty good,” 
Use graphs rather than tables; avoid cluttered figures;
arrange experiments to tell a story, not in the order they were performed; 
include enough data to defend your hypothesis; 
keep about a 50/50 ratio of graphics to text.
